**Enhance Availability of Classic Deluxe Pizza:** Since it leads in quantity and orders, ensure sufficient stock of its ingredients and focus on its upselling potential.
2. Improve Performance of Worst Sellers
Reassess Low Performers: For pizzas like Brie Carré, evaluate whether poor performance is due to lack of awareness, high pricing, or less appeal. Consider rebranding, discounts, or removing them from the menu if unprofitable.
Introduce Variants: Adapt or modify recipes for underperforming pizzas to align better with customer preferences.
3. Leverage Popular Categories and Sizes
Expand Classic Pizza Options: Introduce more variations under the Classic category, as it drives maximum sales.
Focus on Large Pizza Promotions: Since large pizzas dominate sales, design bundle deals or family packs to boost this segment further.

Launch Weekend Offers: Attract more customers by providing exclusive weekend discounts or loyalty rewards.
5. Seasonal and Monthly Campaigns
Target High-Order Months: Focus marketing efforts in July and January with special deals or campaigns to capitalize on increased demand during these months.
Create Seasonal Menus: Use limited-time offers or new flavors to attract customers during slower months like February and April.
6. Improve Average Order Value (AOV)
Cross-Selling and Upselling: Train staff to suggest add-ons like drinks, desserts, or sides with pizza orders.
Bundle Deals: Offer combinations of pizzas, drinks, and sides to encourage larger orders.
